## Getting started:
Use the clone button to download the source code. In the terminal enter the following commands:

```
<!-- To install all the packages listed in the package.json: -->
$ yarn
<!-- Run the app in your localhost: -->
$ yarn start
<!-- Check the console for any issues and if there are check the package.json for any dependancies missing  -->
```

## Brief:
In groups of 4 we had to plan, build, style and test a full-stack MERN application. This included a React frontend that communicated with our backend express API built with MongoDB. We also had to write automated tests for at least one RESTful resource on the back-end.

This was my third project while on General Assemblyâ€™s SEI course.

## User experience:
Beehive is a creative collaboration website that allows users within the creative industry to register for an account, create a personal profile, upload projects they are working on, search for other creatives, request to collaborate on projects and chat with other users. We took heavy inspiration for this project from [The Dots](https://the-dots.com/) which is a website I have used for a number of years. 

1. Homepage, register & login

The landing page of our website shows the Beehive logo with a button to register and a button to start discovering creatives and projects. They can also use the 'start your journey' link in the navbar which takes them to the main search page. We wanted to give an unregistered user enough functionality to show them what Beehive is all about and encourage them to register for an account. Once a user registers, they are taken directly to the login page. When they log in for the first time the user will see a unique welcome page with extra informayion to improve their experience of our site.

2. Search page 

One of the main features of Beehive is the dynamic search page. Here users are able to specify exactly what they are looking for on the left side of the site and results fitting this criteria get filtered down and displayed on the right side.

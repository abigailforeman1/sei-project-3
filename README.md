# General Assembly Project 3: Beehive

## Goal:
Build a full-stack application with React and an Express API.

## Timeframe:
8 days

## Team mates:
* [Jos Bogan](https://github.com/JosBogan/)
* [John Magnus Robertson](https://github.com/jaymagrob/)
* [Nicolas Dolan](https://github.com/Nicolas-Dolan)

## Technologies used:

* Mocha & Chai
* GitHub
* Cloudinary

## Deployment:
This game has been deployed on Heroku and can be found here: https://beehive-project-3.herokuapp.com/

## Getting started:
Use the clone button to download the source code. In the terminal enter the following commands:

```
<!-- To install all the packages listed in the package.json: -->
$ yarn
<!-- Run the app in your localhost: -->
$ yarn start
<!-- Check the console for any issues and if there are check the package.json for any dependancies missing  -->
```

## Brief:
In groups of 4 we had 8 days to plan, build, style and test a full-stack application. This included a React frontend that communicated with our backend express API built with MongoDB. We also had to write automated tests for at least one RESTful resource on the back-end.

This was my third project while on General Assemblyâ€™s SEI course.
